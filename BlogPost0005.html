		<h2>"Reflections"</h2>
		<p><br>What did I learn about creating websites from planning? 
		<br>I learnt that sometimes plans do not work at the start and adjustments to the plan must be made due to limitations of the languages. The website started out without the navigation having to stick to the top of the website, but I have since found it better with it. Another change to the website that was made was the side bars of the article would not be revenant now as there are enough articles to be recommended based on the user’s current article. 
		<br>
		<br>I have also learnt how to animate some sections of the website and use of vendor specific commands to animate. This can be seen in the header where the header is glowing when the mouse hovers over it to make it less annoying. Another animation would be the built in hover zoom so that when a user hovers over the higher quality art portfolio images, they can see a larger view of the pictures.
		<br>
		<br>I have also learnt that commenting in the CSS is a necessity or else my code will not be readable easily. Commenting the code can section the code in a nice way. Sectioning the code will allow easier debugging of the CSS.
		<br>
		<br>I have also learnt that website style should not be changed frequently as one change to the header’s font will require all of the pages to be updated with the correct font stylesheet. This means that the more pages you have on the website, the more work there is to be done to ensure that all of the pages look consistent. For example, I added the social media buttons at a late stage of the development, I have to copy the code for the buttons for all of my website whereas I only have to code one navigation bar as I can just duplicate the main page’s HTML and reformat the content and not have to recopy the navigation bars.
		<br>
		<br>I have also learnt that external stylesheet is not as easy as inline stylesheet as I have to make a new div class for each special styles I put in a specific page. The new class is required as it is only specific for a webpage. Therefore I feel that we should be allowed to use some inline stylesheet where applicable for special single webpages that only have that special effect/colour.
		<br>What steps to take/change to make it better? 
		<br>I can make the website better for the users to use by including javascript in places applicable. I can also make use of other frameworks to allow users to input values into the website for comments. Furthermore, I can leverage on this and make a search engine to find articles on the website based on the tags on the article itself. If implementing a search engine is too hard, I will implement an external search engine such as Google custom search engine.
		<br>
		<br>When browsing for fonts on the internet, I have found that google fonts are the most prominent web font hosting service available. After browsing the fonts on Google for a while, I have found that there aren't any fonts on google font I like and have to use alternative services like Typekit by Adobe. This is such as their search engine for fonts is better than google’s search engine as they can search by classification and font properties. Even though there are a limited amount of font that is available for free, I can find enough free fonts I like to use Adobe fonts. There is a limitation on the free account in that there is a smaller selection of fonts and the ability to use two fonts for one website only. This is limitations I can work with for better fonts that are not hosted by the client as sometimes the client’s browser will not detect locally hosted fonts were making the website look weird. This means that I have to use one of the similar looking fonts on the main website that is hosted on a cloud to ensure my website still looks like what I have intended it to look like.
		<br>
		<br>Other steps I can make my website look better is to include more pictures. The pictures I intend to include on my website will be hand drawn figures, but since I optimise my images on the internet, I intend to make sure that the pictures are done in a vector (.svg) format so that they do not lose quality with a lower file size. As I still do not know how to use illustrator yet, the images on the website will be a little scarce until I learn how to use Illustrator or other similar applications.
